This notebook builds a neural network to classify letters of the alphabet from the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset. It involves data exploration, preprocessing by dropping duplicates and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The notebook then constructs a neural network model, tunes its hyperparameters, and evaluates its performance to achieve high accuracy in letter recognition.
